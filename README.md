Main purpose of this project is to provide test functions, implemented on c++, for testing unconditional minimization algorithms.

Besides providing usual, sequential implementations of test functions, we are also providing concurrent implementations of same functions. Implementations can be found in files testFunctions.h and parallelTestFunctions.h. You can use Source.cpp to run each function.

Project was created by Koba Gelashvili and Luka Gorgadze.
